Learn Clojurescript
===================

A REPL-driven guide for learning programming in Clojurescript, with an emphasis
on the foundations and core idioms: data, functions, and abstractions.

## Getting Started

Install Clojure or Leiningen

	brew install clojure

	brew install leiningen

Start a REPL

    clj --main cljs.main --repl

    rlwrap lein trampoline repl

OR, open your favorite editor (Emacs/Cider, IntelliJ/Cursive), VSCode, and start an repl.

Open 'src' and explore each namespace and walkthrough its available functions.

## Workshops

This is the material for my Clojurescript workshops.
