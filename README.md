Learn Clojurescript
===================

A REPL-driven guide for learning programming in Clojurescript, with an emphasis
on the foundations and Clojure's core idioms: immutable data, functional
composition, and abstractions.

Works on all modern Browsers, iOs, Jvm, and Node.

## Getting Started

Install Leiningen

	brew install leiningen

Start a REPL

	rlwrap lein trampline repl

OR, open your favorite IDE (Emacs/Cider, IntelliJ/Cursive), Atom, and start an nRepl.
